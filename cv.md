Hey. I originally had a couple of paragraphs here trying to explain gaming and trying to tie my gaming career into the more standard corporate world.


Instead, I have a proposal for you, dear HR person reading this.


**Non-gamers**: go talk to whoever you know that plays online games. Co-workers, family, friends. Ask them about League of Legends, tell them about the position you're looking to fill, and ask if they think a top tier League of Legends coach and player would be smart enough to excel at the job.


They'll sell me to you better than I can sell me myself. I can sit here all day writing about how I'm very smart and it'd be just like any other resume, just a stranger self-aggrandizing. I've been a top tier competitor, 99.9 percentile, of my game, one of if not the most played game in the world, for 10 years now. I can learn whatever job and I have the natural drive to try and be the best at whatever it is I do.


But don't hear it from me. I'm just a dude looking for a job trying to improve his chances. Hear it from someone whose opinion you actually trust. **Ask a gamer if they'd at least interview someone with my experience.**


**Gamers**: if you play any kind of competitive online game you know how hard it is to climb the ladder. Especially if you play League. Don't think I need to say anything else. Give me a call, let's talk.
