I'm aware a part of my career is in an emerging field so let me get straight into: what translates?

### I resolve problems
- Playing League of Legends is like playing team Chess in real time. 
- Decisions are based on a gigantic amount of variables.
- It takes thousands of hours to even begin to scratch the surface of the game's strategic depth.

Troubleshooting can be very similar to competitive games. You learn a set of rules, then you solve problems within the scope of those rules.


### I'm a good communicator
- Communicating while playing league is all about being efficient. Plays are quick, you have to be very succinct as a player.
- While as a coach you have to be very good at breaking down difficult concepts, while also being mindful of each player's personality.
- I enjoy writing guides and personally coaching clients. Clients have often praised my ability to explain complex game concepts in simple ways.

Being good at explaining issues to users was a key factor in my success on the service desk.


### I work fast
- I click very accurately and very fast. I do menial work faster than most, and spend less time slogging through interfaces to get more done.
- League's core loop has you thinking about optimizing your time constantly. Finding ways to do tasks as swiftly and efficiently as possible is second nature to me and something I will always be thinking about.

My proudest moments on jobs have been situations where I was able to apply a script or program to do a repetitive task much faster or less manually.
