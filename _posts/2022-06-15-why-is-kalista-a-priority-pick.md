First off, let's VERY briefly talk about your goal as a laner in general: to have pressure in your lane.

- Pressure will usually imply that you can fight against your opponent (and win(important)). 
- If you think you'd win a fight right now, you should try and zone them - walk forward, don't take poke, and get them into the "you can fight me, or you can get off the wave" lose/lose situation.

- Against lower skilled opponents, they might fight you and you will win and get a kill and start your snowball.
  - Spread your advantage and work towards winning the game alongside the strong players on your team. 
  - While your counterpart is grayscreened you can do anything you want completely unmatched: assist on a jungle invade, gank another lane, or help take an objective.
	 
- When starting to face higher tier players it won't be that easy as people will know when they lose the all-in and they'll play to respect it. Sporting pristine knowledge of your champion's ranges, patterns of engaging, and cooldowns, these players will be much better at leveraging this information to gracefully dance around your highest threat moments while still being able to farm. 
  - Zone them off the wave while managing health and cooldowns in order to maintain your winning position on the all-in. You have to always be ready to fight and win. If you miss important cooldowns or take unanswered damage, the power balance might shift and you won't have as much threat to leverage to keep zoning.
  - Set up a slow push. Last hit as late as possible and you'll soon arrive at their tower with a gigantic stacked wave. 
  - Now you can branch onto a dive with your team to make them lose all that wave, or onto moving & spreading your advantage knowing you can't be matched unless they're willing to give up all those creeps - forcing them into another lose/lose.



Kalista has a very unique kit which makes her kind of cheat at some aspects of the "winning lane" pattern outlined above.
The pieces that make up the Kalista puzzle:

### A ton of damage
Kalista hurts is the understatement of the century. All 3 basic abilities do damage and their damage/level ratio is ridiculous for all 3 as well.
- Q gives +65 damage per level which is completely insane and almost double of what some abilities get like Pantheon Q that gives +35 dmg/lvl.
- W is a contender for best one point wonder in the entire game, adding a gigantic 14% target's max HP as magic damage.
- E is Kalista's trap card to ensure you win every fight that goes long. A single point in E early game means every autoattack does around 130% of its normal damage. 
  - Rend's strength in long trades is mitigated by these two clauses, but the fact that Rend damage doesn't have a practical upper cap means you will win 99% of long fights especially early in the game as champion ability damage is capped by skill points invested. 

This means the requirement of "winning the all in" will be auto-fulfilled for Kalista players in 99% of situations, making it super easy for Kalista to set up lane pressure and a zoning situation.

On top of doing a lot of damage, all of Kalista's abilities have

### Incredible uptime
Kalista's cooldowns are very brief and her mana costs are almost nonexistent
- Q sports an 8 second cooldown and it costs 50-70 mana.
- W has a 10 second per target cooldown, it costs no mana.
- E has a 0 second cooldown and it costs 20-0 mana (when used skillfully. 14-8 seconds cooldown if the reset is missed)

It's very hard to find a gap in the lane phase where Kalista isn't ready to fight you. Even if the Kalista player misses Q, that's only an 8 second short window where it's hard to do something meaningful to the wave to save yourself from the incoming dive. The longest you can have is 14 seconds of respite and that literally depends on the Kalista player making a mistake and missing a Rend reset.

Once Kalista starts to zone you, it will be very hard to find a moment where you can fight her because of no cooldowns on her part.

So how do we beat Kalista? Let's go back to what Kalista is trying to do:

```
Zone them off the wave while managing health and cooldowns in order to maintain your winning position
on the all-in. You have to always be ready to fight and win. If you miss important cooldowns or take 
unanswered damage, the power balance might shift and you won't have as much threat to leverage to keep zoning.
```

Landing unanswered damage is usually easier the more range you have over your opponent. You want to zone me? You need to be able to walk forward at me and get into a fight. I have longer range, so there's a distance I can try to keep where I can hit you but you can't hit me.


Usually the shorter ranged champions tend to have a way to close the distance in their abilities.
Kalista differs in that her gap closer is her

### Passive
Kalista's dash is the only dash in the game that has no cooldown and no manacost.
As long as minions are around, Kalista will be able to move faster than you in any direction she wishes. Engaging is trivial with this dash if opponents don't respect a huge area around the wave. Disengaging is also trivial as we have no cooldown, so Kalista can apply and keep up 100% of her pressure regardless of the map state since she can just hop out if something unexpected happens.
The noncommital nature of her hops is especially useful if you're trying to zone a higher range champion, as you can freely try to dash into his range without giving up precious seconds of pressure. If Lucian tries to dash into a Xerath, he has one attempt to win the trade before being met with 24 seconds of weakness. Kalista has almost no moments of weakness if played well.
	
This unique jumping mechanic further adds to her incredible uptime and helps tie together her identity as a perma-fighter. 
	
Finally, her
### Ultimate
Gives any support a 1200 range alistar combo, which makes zoning extremely easy post 6 as you can almost always threaten a fight against anyone on your screen.
	

To summarize, Kalista is:

- Wins most all ins, can't fight 2v2 or 3v3
- Very good at zoning, she will generate a lot of dives or a lot of tempo to spread her advantage somewhere else
- Lots of damage+very good engage on R means Kalista is an absolute menace when spreading her advantage. You are stronger than every other adc at first/second dragon and first herald and, due to your lane pressure, you are much more likely to be able to join fights unmatched.
	

#The Gameplan Warping Effect

This is the aspect of Kalista that most flies over the average spectator's head.
Obviously if the best bot laner in the game is left alone she will be super ahead most of the time. It's almost impossible to win lane 2v2 vs Kalista.

What do we do then? Do we match her or trade sides?
Matching sides is really hard if you lose 2v2 because you will most likely lose 3v3 with junglers and 4v4 with midlaners.
  - You can only fight bot with more numbers so you're forced to stomp mid+jungle so that they can 4v2 bot with their advantage.
    - Draft is already very hard as you need to have a strong 2v2 matchup botlane capable of not getting crushed by Kalista but also a 2v2 matchup in mid/jungle that can dominate the midlane and the river and come out with a bigger advantage than the one Kalista will 100% get from her first few minutes of 2v2 bot. 
- **Matching Kalista in order to play for your botlane requires you to play and draft for mid/jungle to be very ahead**


Trading sides is similarly very hard. If your mid and jungler play for toplane, even if you win and get your toplaner very ahead, its likely that Kalista will have amassed a bigger advantage on the opposite side because her champion is best in class at playing to get advantages.

Both gameplans have to be very carefully orchestrated from the very first picks of the draft, they both require a hefty amount of individual execution and team preparation, and in both cases it's much easier for you to make a mistake than it is for Kalista to make a mistake. Also you might prefer to play for botlane, or play for jungle, due to the individuals in your team. 

If their best player is their ad carry, first picking Kalista makes it so that their default gameplan of "let's play for bot and snowball our best player" suddenly becomes much, much harder to execute. The versatility required of a team to navigate through different gameplans at the same level of execution is something only world class teams can develop and this is why I think it's a lot easier in a lot of situations to "just ban kalista lol" even if the champion can seem underwhelming in some games to the naked spectator's eye.
